# Challenge 10: Finalization and Submission Package

**Goal:** Finalize the script and generate the results for the private dataset.

**Tasks:**
1.  Perform a final code review of your `run.sh` script. Check for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to all project requirements (e.g., no external dependencies, correct output format).
2.  Add comments to the script to explain the key logic sections, making it understandable for future review.
3.  Execute the `./generate_results.sh` script. This will run your `run.sh` against the `private_cases.json` file and produce the `private_results.txt` file.
4.  Do not attempt to view or modify `private_results.txt`. The file is now ready for submission.

**Expected Outcome:** A clean, well-documented `run.sh` script and the `private_results.txt` file required for the final evaluation. Your reverse-engineering task is now complete.
