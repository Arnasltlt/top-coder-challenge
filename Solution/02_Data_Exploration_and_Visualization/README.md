# Challenge 2: Data Exploration and Visualization

**Goal:** Analyze the `public_cases.json` data to understand its structure and identify initial patterns.

**Tasks:**
1.  Write a script (e.g., in Python or another language of your choice) to parse `public_cases.json`.
2.  Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) for each input (`trip_duration_days`, `miles_traveled`, `total_receipts_amount`) and the `reimbursement_amount`.
3.  Generate visualizations:
    *   Histograms for each input and the output to understand their distributions.
    *   Scatter plots to explore relationships between each input and the reimbursement amount (e.g., `miles_traveled` vs. `reimbursement_amount`).

**Expected Outcome:** A set of summary statistics and plots that will inform initial hypotheses about the reimbursement logic.
