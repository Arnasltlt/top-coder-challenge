## üîç SYSTEMATIC ERROR PATTERNS

### **Pattern A: 1-Day Trip Over-Predictions**
- **Cases**: 61 cases with systematic over-prediction by $92.32
- **Root Cause**: Current model doesn't penalize high 1-day spending enough
- **Fix Strategy**: Implement progressive penalty for 1-day trips based on daily spending

### **Pattern B: 5-Day Trip Over-Predictions** 
- **Cases**: 91 cases with systematic over-prediction by $95.47
- **Root Cause**: Our 18% bonus is still too high
- **Fix Strategy**: Reduce 5-day bonus or add conditional logic

### **Pattern C: 6-Day Trip Under-Predictions**
- **Cases**: 62 cases with systematic under-prediction by $113.23
- **Root Cause**: No special handling for 6-day trips
- **Fix Strategy**: Implement 6-day bonus (similar to 5-day logic)

### **Pattern D: 7-Day Trip Under-Predictions**
- **Cases**: 33 cases with systematic under-prediction by $60.37
- **Root Cause**: Missing 7-day bonus for high-mileage cases
- **Fix Strategy**: Conditional 7-day bonus for high miles

### **Pattern E: Long Trip Issues (10+ days)**
- **Cases**: Multiple long trips (10-14 days) with over-predictions
- **Root Cause**: Linear scaling doesn't account for diminishing returns
- **Fix Strategy**: Enhanced long-trip penalty progression

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: High-Impact Quick Wins**
1. Implement LOW_MILES_HIGH_RECEIPTS_PENALTY (targets Cases 114, 243)
2. Add ONE_DAY_EXTREME_SPENDING_PENALTY (targets Cases 83, 82)
3. Create SEVEN_DAY_HIGH_MILES_BONUS (targets Cases 668, 326)

**Expected Impact**: Should fix 6-8 of top 10 worst cases

### **Phase 2: Systematic Pattern Fixes**
1. Add SIX_DAY_TRIP_BONUS
2. Enhance LONG_TRIP_PENALTY
3. Adjust FIVE_DAY_BONUS

**Expected Impact**: Should improve 100+ cases

### **Phase 3: Fine-Tuning**
1. Test each rule independently
2. Optimize thresholds and percentages
3. Validate no regressions on good cases
