# Challenge 3: Interview Analysis and Hypothesis Generation

**Goal:** Extract actionable insights from the `INTERVIEWS.md` file.

**Tasks:**
1.  Read through the `INTERVIEWS.md` document.
2.  Identify and list every potential rule, heuristic, or piece of logic mentioned by the interviewees (e.g., "I think there's a $55 per diem," "Long trips get a bonus").
3.  Categorize the extracted statements (e.g., by per diem, mileage, receipts, special conditions).
4.  For each statement, formulate a specific, testable hypothesis. For example, "Hypothesis: A flat rate of $55 is added to the reimbursement for each `trip_duration_day`."

**Expected Outcome:** A structured document containing a list of hypotheses about the system's logic, which will guide the modeling efforts in subsequent steps.
