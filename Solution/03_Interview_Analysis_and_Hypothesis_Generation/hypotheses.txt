# Travel Reimbursement System - Extracted Hypotheses

## PER DIEM CALCULATIONS

### Base Per Diem Rate
- **Rule:** $100 per day base per diem rate
- **Hypothesis:** A flat rate of $100 is added to the reimbursement for each `trip_duration_day`.

### Trip Length Bonuses
- **Rule:** 5-day trips get a bonus
- **Hypothesis:** Trips with exactly 5 days (`trip_duration_day == 5`) receive an additional bonus amount on top of base per diem.

### Sweet Spot Duration
- **Rule:** 4-6 day trips get particularly good treatment
- **Hypothesis:** Trips with duration between 4-6 days (`trip_duration_day >= 4 AND trip_duration_day <= 6`) receive enhanced reimbursement rates.

## MILEAGE CALCULATIONS

### Tiered Mileage System
- **Rule:** First 100 miles at full rate (58 cents/mile), then drops
- **Hypothesis:** Mileage reimbursement uses a tiered system: first 100 miles at $0.58/mile, remaining miles at a reduced rate.

### Non-Linear Mileage Curve
- **Rule:** Mileage follows a logarithmic or curved pattern, not linear
- **Hypothesis:** Total mileage reimbursement follows a logarithmic curve where per-mile rate decreases as total mileage increases.

### High Mileage Threshold Effects
- **Rule:** 800-mile trips may get better per-mile rates than 600-mile trips
- **Hypothesis:** There are specific mileage thresholds (e.g., 800+ miles) that trigger improved per-mile rates.

## EFFICIENCY BONUSES

### Miles-Per-Day Optimization
- **Rule:** 180-220 miles per day is the optimal range for bonuses
- **Hypothesis:** Trips with daily mileage between 180-220 miles (`total_mileage / trip_duration_day`) receive efficiency bonuses.

### Efficiency Penalty Thresholds
- **Rule:** Very low or very high daily mileage gets penalized
- **Hypothesis:** Daily mileage below 180 or above 220 miles results in reimbursement penalties.

### "Effort" Recognition
- **Rule:** System rewards high activity/hustle
- **Hypothesis:** High mileage combined with multi-day trips receives "effort bonuses" beyond standard calculations.

## RECEIPT PROCESSING

### Receipt Reimbursement Curve
- **Rule:** $600-800 in receipts get optimal treatment, diminishing returns above
- **Hypothesis:** Receipt reimbursement follows a curve where $600-800 range gets highest percentage reimbursed, with diminishing returns for higher amounts.

### Small Receipt Penalty
- **Rule:** Very small receipt amounts (under $50-80) get penalized compared to no receipts
- **Hypothesis:** Submitting receipts under $50 results in lower total reimbursement than submitting no receipts at all.

### Daily Spending Limits
- **Rule:** Optimal daily spending varies by trip length
- **Hypothesis:** 
  - Short trips: under $75/day optimal
  - Medium trips (4-6 days): up to $120/day optimal  
  - Long trips: under $90/day optimal

### Receipt Total Caps
- **Rule:** Hard or soft caps on receipt reimbursement
- **Hypothesis:** Receipt reimbursement has diminishing returns above certain thresholds, with possible hard caps around $800-1000.

## TEMPORAL FACTORS

### End-of-Quarter Generosity
- **Rule:** Q4 end and quarter-end periods are more generous
- **Hypothesis:** Submissions in the last month of quarters, especially Q4, receive bonus multipliers.

### Day-of-Week Effects
- **Rule:** Tuesday submissions outperform Friday submissions
- **Hypothesis:** Submission day affects reimbursement with Tuesday > Thursday > other days > Friday.

### Monthly Cycles
- **Rule:** Early month vs late month differences
- **Hypothesis:** Submissions in early month (days 1-10) receive different treatment than late month (days 20-31).

### Lunar Cycle Correlation
- **Rule:** New moon submissions average 4% higher than full moon
- **Hypothesis:** Reimbursement amounts correlate with moon phases, with new moon periods receiving slight bonuses.

## COMBINATION EFFECTS

### "Sweet Spot Combo"
- **Rule:** 5 days + 180+ miles/day + under $100/day = guaranteed bonus
- **Hypothesis:** The combination of exactly 5 days, 180+ daily miles, and under $100 daily spending triggers a guaranteed bonus.

### "Vacation Penalty"
- **Rule:** 8+ day trips with high spending get penalized
- **Hypothesis:** Trips of 8+ days with high daily spending (over threshold) receive significant penalties.

### High Mileage + Low Spending Bonus
- **Rule:** High mileage with modest spending gets rewarded
- **Hypothesis:** Trips with above-average mileage and below-average spending per day receive efficiency bonuses.

### Low Mileage + High Spending Penalty
- **Rule:** Low mileage with high spending gets penalized
- **Hypothesis:** Trips with below-average mileage and above-average spending receive penalties for perceived inefficiency.

## PERSONALIZATION/ADAPTATION

### User History Effects
- **Rule:** System remembers user history and adjusts accordingly
- **Hypothesis:** Users with recent high-expense submissions receive reduced reimbursement rates, while users with modest history receive bonuses.

### Department Variations
- **Rule:** Different departments may have different calculation paths
- **Hypothesis:** Sales, Finance, Operations, etc. have different base rates or bonus structures.

### Learning/Adaptation Component
- **Rule:** System evolves user profiles over time
- **Hypothesis:** The system builds user profiles and adjusts reimbursement algorithms based on historical behavior patterns.

## RANDOMIZATION/NOISE

### Intentional Randomization
- **Rule:** System includes random variation to prevent gaming
- **Hypothesis:** 5-10% random variation is added to final reimbursement amounts to prevent predictable optimization.

### External Data Integration
- **Rule:** System may use market indices or external data for variation
- **Hypothesis:** Reimbursement calculations incorporate external data sources (market conditions, company performance) as multipliers.

## ROUNDING/CALCULATION QUIRKS

### Favorable Rounding Bug
- **Rule:** Receipts ending in 49 or 99 cents get extra money
- **Hypothesis:** Receipt totals ending in specific cent amounts (49¢, 99¢) trigger double-rounding or calculation errors that favor the user.

### Magic Number Theory
- **Rule:** Certain receipt totals (like $847) are "lucky"
- **Hypothesis:** Specific total amounts trigger favorable calculation paths due to legacy code or rounding behaviors.

## TRIP CATEGORIZATION

### Multiple Calculation Paths
- **Rule:** At least 6 different calculation paths based on trip characteristics
- **Hypothesis:** The system categorizes trips into distinct types (quick/high-mileage, long/low-mileage, balanced, etc.) and applies different calculation algorithms to each category.

### Threshold-Based Categorization
- **Rule:** Specific combinations trigger different calculation modes
- **Hypothesis:** Combinations of trip_duration_day, total_mileage, and receipt_total determine which of several calculation algorithms is used for final reimbursement.
