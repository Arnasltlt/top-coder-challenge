# ðŸš€ BREAKTHROUGH STRATEGIES: 5 Untried Approaches

## Executive Summary

After reaching ~$188 MAE with conventional approaches, these 5 radical strategies explore completely different paradigms for cracking the ACME reimbursement system. Each represents a fundamental shift in thinking, moving beyond traditional ML/statistical approaches.

## ðŸ§  Strategy 11: Brute Force Memorization
**Engineering:** LOW | **Speculation:** HIGH

### Core Idea
Abandon pattern-finding entirely. Memorize all 1000 training cases and use sophisticated interpolation for new cases.

### Why It Might Work
- 60-year-old systems often accumulate special cases rather than elegant algorithms
- "Mrs. Johnson from accounting remembers a case just like this..."
- Training set might contain ALL the edge cases needed

### Implementation
- Perfect lookup table for exact matches
- Weighted interpolation for similar cases
- Fallback to current model for outliers

---

## ðŸ“… Strategy 12: Temporal/Calendar Logic
**Engineering:** LOW | **Speculation:** VERY HIGH  

### Core Idea
Hidden calendar-based logic from 1960s batch processing cycles, fiscal periods, or computing calendar bugs.

### Why It Might Work
- 1960s batch processing was time-dependent
- Fiscal quarter budgets affected reimbursement policies
- Case index might proxy for processing time/order

### Implementation
- Map case indices to fiscal quarters
- Simulate 1960s batch processing cycles
- Test for leap year, fiscal calendar, payroll cycle effects

## ðŸ”¢ Strategy 13: Precision Artifact Analysis
**Engineering:** MEDIUM | **Speculation:** MEDIUM

### Core Idea
Focus on exact rounding, precision, and computational artifacts from 1960s computing systems.

### Why It Might Work
- Penny-perfect outputs suggest specific rounding algorithms
- IBM System/360 had distinctive arithmetic behaviors
- Fixed-point vs floating-point calculation differences

### Implementation
- Analyze cent digit distributions
- Simulate vintage fixed-point arithmetic
- Test banker's rounding, truncation patterns

---

## ðŸ‘” Strategy 14: Employee Classification Inference
**Engineering:** MEDIUM | **Speculation:** MEDIUM

### Core Idea
Cases represent different employee types (executives, senior sales, junior sales) with distinct reimbursement policies.

### Why It Might Work
- 1960s companies had rigid hierarchical structures
- Different roles had different travel budgets
- Observable patterns in spending behavior

### Implementation
- Unsupervised clustering of cases
- Model 1960s corporate hierarchies
- Territory/department-based variations

---

## ðŸ’» Strategy 15: Minimalist 1960s Programmer Mindset
**Engineering:** LOW | **Speculation:** HIGH

### Core Idea
Think like a 1960s COBOL programmer with 3 months to build a system. What's the simplest thing that could work?

### Why It Might Work
- Occam's razor: simplest explanation often correct
- 1960s constraints favored simple, hardcoded solutions
- Complex behavior might emerge from simple rules

### Implementation
- Ultra-simple lookup tables
- Hardcoded special cases
- "Good enough" engineering philosophy

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Low Engineering)
1. **Strategy 15**: Ultra-minimal model - test in 1 hour
2. **Strategy 12**: Temporal patterns - analyze case index correlation
3. **Strategy 11**: Basic memorization/interpolation

### Phase 2: Deep Dives (Medium Engineering)  
4. **Strategy 14**: Employee clustering analysis
5. **Strategy 13**: Precision artifact detection

---

## ðŸ’¡ Breakthrough Potential

### Highest Impact Scenarios
- **Strategy 15** discovers the system is embarrassingly simple
- **Strategy 11** achieves perfect interpolation from training data
- **Strategy 13** fixes systematic rounding errors

### Combination Strategies
- **15 + 13**: Simple logic with vintage precision
- **14 + 12**: Employee types with temporal adjustments
- **11 + Any**: Memorization as ultimate fallback

---

## ðŸ”¬ Success Metrics

1. **Immediate Impact**: Any strategy that reduces MAE below $150
2. **Breakthrough Territory**: MAE below $100
3. **Holy Grail**: MAE below $50 (challenge target was $25)

## ðŸš¨ Key Insights

### What We've Learned
1. Conventional ML approaches hit a ceiling around $188 MAE
2. The system has 60+ years of accumulated business logic
3. 1960s constraints shaped the fundamental architecture
4. "Reasonable and necessary" policies create non-linear patterns

### What We Haven't Tried
1. **Radical simplification** (Strategy 15)
2. **Complete memorization** (Strategy 11) 
3. **Historical context modeling** (Strategies 12, 14)
4. **Low-level precision engineering** (Strategy 13)
