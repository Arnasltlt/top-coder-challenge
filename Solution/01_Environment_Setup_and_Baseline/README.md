# Challenge 1: Environment Setup and Baseline

**Goal:** Configure the development environment and establish a baseline performance metric.

**Tasks:**
1.  Copy the `run.sh.template` file to `run.sh` in the root of the `top-coder-challenge` directory.
2.  Execute the `./eval.sh` script without any modifications to the `run.sh` file.
3.  Record the initial results for "Exact matches," "Close matches," and "Average error."

**Expected Outcome:** A functioning evaluation harness and an initial, low-performance score that serves as the starting baseline for improvement.
