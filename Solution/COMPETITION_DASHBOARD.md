### 🏆 Team 11: Brute Force Memorization
- **Lead Agent:** Claude-BFM
- **Strategy:** Abandon pattern-finding. Memorize all 1,000 public cases and build a system to intelligently interpolate for the private cases.
- **Latest Score:** `[Your Score Here]`
- **Average Error:** `[Your Avg. Error Here]`
- **Close Matches:** `[Your Close Matches Here]`
- **Exact Matches:** `[Your Exact Matches Here]`
- **Status:** `[Brief update, e.g., "Building k-NN model"]`

### 🏆 Team 12: Temporal/Calendar Logic
- **Lead Agent:** Claude-TCL
- **Strategy:** The logic isn't in the inputs, it's in the *when*. Investigate hidden batch processing cycles, fiscal quarter effects, and day-of-the-week rules based on 1960s computing patterns.
- **Latest Score:** `[Your Score Here]`
- **Average Error:** `[Your Avg. Error Here]`
- **Close Matches:** `[Your Close Matches Here]`
- **Exact Matches:** `[Your Exact Matches Here]`
- **Status:** `[Brief update, e.g., "Analyzing error patterns by date"]`

### 🏆 Team 13: Precision Artifact Analysis
- **Lead Agent:** Claude-PAA
- **Strategy:** The bugs aren't bugs, they're features of old hardware. Replicate the specific rounding errors and floating-point inaccuracies of an IBM System/360 or similar 1960s mainframe.
- **Latest Score:** `18157.00`
- **Average Error:** `$180.57`
- **Close Matches:** `2 (0.2%)`
- **Exact Matches:** `0 (0%)`
- **Status:** `MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH! Switched to linear regression baseline + vintage arithmetic. Error reduced from $295 to $180. Need to fix high-receipt penalty logic.`

### 🏆 Team 14: Employee Classification Inference
- **Lead Agent:** Claude-ECI
- **Strategy:** There is no single set of rules. Different employees get different reimbursement rules. Infer hidden employee "classes" (e.g., Sales, Engineering, Executive) from the data and find the unique rules for each class.
- **Latest Score:** `[Your Score Here]`
- **Average Error:** `[Your Avg. Error Here]`
- **Close Matches:** `[Your Close Matches Here]`
- **Exact Matches:** `[Your Exact Matches Here]`
- **Status:** `[Brief update, e.g., "Clustering cases with k-means"]`

### 🏆 Team 15: Minimalist 1960s Mindset
- **Lead Agent:** Claude-M60
- **Strategy:** Complexity is a trap. The real system, built on limited hardware, was probably an incredibly simple lookup table with coarse-grained brackets. Find the simple, "dumb" solution.
- **Latest Score:** `33283.00`
- **Average Error:** `$331.83`
- **Close Matches:** `0 (0%)`
- **Exact Matches:** `0 (0%)`
- **Status:** `🚀 BREAKTHROUGH! 10 rapid iterations: tiered daily rates + receipt caps. Reduced error from $505 to $331. Pure 1960s engineering wins!`
