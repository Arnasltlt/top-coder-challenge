# Strategy 12: Temporal/Calendar Logic Analysis

**ENGINEERING COMPLEXITY: LOW (Highly Speculative)**

## Core Hypothesis

What if the ACME reimbursement system has hidden temporal logic based on 1960s batch processing cycles, fiscal periods, or even specific calendar quirks from that era?

## The Revolutionary Idea

The 1960s context reveals batch processing was king. What if reimbursement amounts secretly depend on:
- **Fiscal quarter boundaries** (different rates per quarter)
- **Month-end processing** (higher/lower amounts based on monthly quotas)
- **Payroll cycles** (bi-weekly/monthly payment schedules affecting calculations)
- **Calendar artifacts** from 1960s systems (leap years, specific dates)

## Strategy Details

### Phase 1: Reverse-Engineer Hidden Calendar Logic
Since we don't have actual submission dates, we'll use **case index position** as a proxy for temporal patterns:
- Cases 1-250: Q1 fiscal period behavior
- Cases 251-500: Q2 fiscal period behavior  
- Cases 501-750: Q3 fiscal period behavior
- Cases 751-1000: Q4 fiscal period behavior

### Phase 2: 1960s Batch Processing Simulation
```python
def temporal_adjustment(case_index, base_amount):
    # Simulate 1960s batch processing quirks
    
    # Month-end surge (cases processed in batches)
    if case_index % 50 < 5:  # "Month-end batch"
        return base_amount * 1.05  # 5% bonus for month-end processing
    
    # Quarter-end budget constraints
    quarter = (case_index - 1) // 250
    if quarter == 3:  # Q4 - year-end budget squeeze
        return base_amount * 0.95
    
    # Fiscal year calendar logic
    fiscal_week = (case_index % 52) + 1
    if fiscal_week > 48:  # Year-end rush
        return base_amount * 0.92
    
    return base_amount
```

### Phase 3: Vintage Computing Calendar Bugs
Simulate common 1960s calendar processing errors:
- **Leap year bugs**: Different calculations for leap years
- **Julian vs Gregorian**: Old systems sometimes mixed date formats
- **Weekend processing**: Different rates for trips processed on weekends

## Why This Could Work

### Historical Evidence
1. **1960s Batch Processing**: Everything was processed in batches at specific times
2. **Fiscal Period Dependencies**: Budget constraints varied by quarter
3. **Payroll Cycle Integration**: Reimbursements often tied to payroll schedules
4. **Manual Calendar Logic**: Clerks followed different procedures for different times of year

### Real-World Precedents
- **Per diem rates**: Often changed quarterly or annually
- **Budget constraints**: Companies had stricter reimbursement policies near fiscal year-end
- **Processing delays**: Different approval levels for different fiscal periods

## Implementation Strategy

### Method 1: Case Index Temporal Patterns
```python
def analyze_temporal_patterns():
    # Group cases by position (proxy for processing time)
    quarters = []
    for i in range(4):
        start_idx = i * 250
        end_idx = (i + 1) * 250
        quarter_cases = public_cases[start_idx:end_idx]
        quarters.append(analyze_quarter(quarter_cases))
    
    # Look for systematic differences between quarters
    return compare_quarters(quarters)
```

### Method 2: Cyclic Pattern Detection
```python
def find_cyclic_patterns():
    # Test various cycle lengths (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
    for cycle_length in [7, 14, 30, 52, 90]:
        pattern = []
        for i in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_cases = [cases[j] for j in range(len(cases)) if j % cycle_length == i]
            pattern.append(analyze_cycle_group(cycle_cases))
        
        if has_significant_pattern(pattern):
            return cycle_length, pattern
```

### Method 3: Vintage Date Logic Simulation
```python
def vintage_date_adjustment(case_info):
    # Simulate how 1960s systems might process dates
    
    # Assume case index correlates to submission order
    simulated_date = base_date + timedelta(days=case_info.index)
    
    # 1960s fiscal calendar (many companies used April-March)
    fiscal_month = ((simulated_date.month - 4) % 12) + 1
    
    # Quarter-based adjustments
    if fiscal_month <= 3:  # Q1: Generous new-year budgets
        return 1.03
    elif fiscal_month <= 6:  # Q2: Standard processing
        return 1.00
    elif fiscal_month <= 9:  # Q3: Mid-year adjustments
        return 0.98
    else:  # Q4: Year-end constraints
        return 0.95
```

## Breakthrough Scenarios

### Scenario A: Fiscal Calendar Discovery
The system secretly adjusts reimbursements based on fiscal quarter, explaining some of the "random" variation in our current model.

### Scenario B: Batch Processing Artifacts
Different approval levels or calculation methods were used for different processing batches, creating predictable patterns based on case order.

### Scenario C: Vintage Calendar Bugs
The original 1960s system had calendar-related bugs that were never fixed, creating systematic biases for certain date ranges.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Compare mean reimbursements across different case index ranges
2. **Cycle Detection**: Use FFT or autocorrelation to find periodic patterns
3. **Validation**: Apply discovered temporal adjustments to current best model
