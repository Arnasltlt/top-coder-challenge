# Strategy 11: Brute Force Memorization Approach

**ENGINEERING COMPLEXITY: LOW (Speculative)**

## Core Hypothesis

What if the 60-year-old ACME reimbursement system isn't trying to be smart at all? What if it's literally just a massive lookup table or memorization system that has accumulated thousands of specific cases over decades?

## The Radical Idea

Instead of trying to find mathematical patterns, completely memorize the 1000 training cases and use sophisticated interpolation/similarity matching for new cases.

## Strategy Details

### Phase 1: Perfect Memorization
- Build exact lookup table for all 1000 public cases
- For any exact match: return the exact reimbursement amount
- Success metric: 100% accuracy on training set

### Phase 2: Intelligent Interpolation
- For new cases, find the 3-5 "most similar" cases from training set
- Use weighted interpolation based on:
  - Euclidean distance in (days, miles, receipts) space
  - Manhattan distance for robustness
  - Custom similarity metrics (e.g., receipts/day, miles/day)

### Phase 3: Hybrid Fallback
- If no similar cases exist, fall back to current best model
- Define "similarity threshold" to determine when to trust interpolation

## Why This Might Work

1. **Legacy System Reality**: 60-year-old systems often accumulate special cases rather than elegant algorithms
2. **Accounting Department Logic**: "Mrs. Johnson from accounting remembers handling a case just like this in 1987..."
3. **Exception-Driven Development**: Each weird case might have been hardcoded as a special rule

## Implementation Approach

```python
def memorization_model(days, miles, receipts):
    # Step 1: Check for exact match
    key = (days, miles, receipts)
    if key in training_lookup:
        return training_lookup[key]
    
    # Step 2: Find similar cases
    similarities = []
    for train_case in training_data:
        distance = compute_similarity(
            (days, miles, receipts), 
            (train_case.days, train_case.miles, train_case.receipts)
        )
        similarities.append((distance, train_case.reimbursement))
    
    # Step 3: Weighted interpolation of top 5 matches
    top_5 = sorted(similarities)[:5]
    weights = [1/max(dist, 0.001) for dist, _ in top_5]
    weighted_avg = sum(w * reimbursement for w, (_, reimbursement) in zip(weights, top_5))
    return weighted_avg / sum(weights)
```

## Potential Breakthrough Scenarios

- **Scenario A**: Training set contains representative samples of ALL the weird edge cases
- **Scenario B**: The 5000 private test cases are variations of the 1000 public cases
- **Scenario C**: System behavior is fundamentally non-algorithmic and based on precedent

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Overfitting to training data
- **Medium Risk**: Poor generalization to unseen patterns
- **Low Risk**: Easy to implement and test quickly

## Success Metrics

- Phase 1: 100% accuracy on public cases (by definition)
- Phase 2: >95% accuracy on cross-validation splits
- Phase 3: Improved performance on holdout test set
