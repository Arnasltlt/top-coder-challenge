# Model Evaluation Report - First 50 Test Cases

## Executive Summary

The current model **FAILS** the readiness criteria for full evaluation. While it performs excellently on short trips (1-3 days), it has significant issues with longer trips, particularly 5+ day trips.

### Key Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: $99.85 (Target: <$60) ❌
- **Accuracy Rate**: 36.0% of cases with error <$20 (Target: >60%) ❌

## Performance by Trip Duration

### Excellent Performance (1-3 days)
- **1-day trips**: 100% accuracy rate, MAE $6.52 ✅
- **3-day trips**: 71.4% accuracy rate, MAE $21.18 ✅

### Moderate Performance (2 days)
- **2-day trips**: 20% accuracy rate, MAE $35.60 ⚠️
- Systematic under-prediction by $35.60 on average

### Poor Performance (5+ days)
- **5-day trips**: 5% accuracy rate, MAE $140.98 ❌
- **8+ day trips**: Highly inconsistent, large systematic biases ❌

## Major Issues Identified

### 1. Long Trip Handling (5+ days)
- 16 out of 20 five-day trips have errors ≥$50
- Systematic over-prediction for 5-day trips (+$40.54 average)
- Model coefficients don't scale properly for extended trips

### 2. Receipt Processing Logic
The model struggles with high-receipt cases:
- Case 22: 5 days, $1337.90 receipts → Error $280.61
- Case 26: 5 days, $464.94 receipts → Error $318.91

### 3. Very Long Trips (8+ days)
- Extreme variability in performance
- Over-prediction bias for most durations
- Pattern recognition breaks down completely

## Worst 5 Cases Analysis

1. **Case 48**: 12 days, 781 miles, $1159.18 receipts
   - Predicted: $2167.54, Actual: $1752.72, Error: $414.82
   - Issue: Long trip coefficient too aggressive

2. **Case 42**: 11 days, 927 miles, $1994.33 receipts
   - Predicted: $2187.51, Actual: $1779.12, Error: $408.39
   - Issue: High mileage + receipt combination over-counted

3. **Case 47**: 9 days, 218 miles, $1203.45 receipts
   - Predicted: $1224.34, Actual: $1561.63, Error: $337.29
   - Issue: Low mileage penalty applied incorrectly for long trips

4. **Case 26**: 5 days, 261 miles, $464.94 receipts
   - Predicted: $940.03, Actual: $621.12, Error: $318.91
   - Issue: Receipt rate scaling problems

5. **Case 22**: 5 days, 173 miles, $1337.90 receipts
   - Predicted: $1163.35, Actual: $1443.96, Error: $280.61
   - Issue: High receipts not handled properly

## Recommended Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Recalibrate 5-day trip coefficients**
   - Reduce base rate and mileage multiplier
   - Fix receipt processing for high-spending cases

2. **Fix 2-day trip under-prediction**
   - Increase base amount from $150 to ~$185
   - Adjust coefficients to match actual patterns

3. **Rework long trip logic (8+ days)**
   - Current vacation penalty is too aggressive
   - Need separate handling for different spending patterns

### Medium Priority
1. **Receipt threshold adjustments**
   - Current $120 daily spending threshold too low
   - Diminishing returns penalty too harsh

2. **Mileage efficiency bonuses**
   - Review optimal range (180-220 miles/day)
   - Consider trip duration in efficiency calculation

## Success Areas to Preserve

### 1-Day Trips (Perfect Performance)
- Current logic is excellent
- Base: $80, Miles: $0.65/mile, Receipts: $1.20 multiplier

### 3-Day Trips (Strong Performance)
- Good overall structure
- Minor tweaks needed for extreme cases only

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on 5-day trip recalibration** - This is 40% of failing cases
2. **Fix 2-day trip systematic bias** - Quick win for accuracy rate
3. **Redesign 8+ day logic** - Currently fundamentally flawed
4. **Test iteratively** - Small changes, measure impact

The model shows strong foundational logic but needs significant refinement for longer trips before full evaluation readiness.
