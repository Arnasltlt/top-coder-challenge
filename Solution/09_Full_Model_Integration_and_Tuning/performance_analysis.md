# Model Performance Analysis - First 30 Test Cases

## Executive Summary

The current model at `/Users/seima/8090/top-coder-challenge/run.sh` shows significant performance issues when tested against the first 30 cases from `public_cases.json`. **The model is NOT ready for full evaluation and requires substantial fine-tuning.**

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error**: $127.73 (very high)
- **Median Absolute Error**: $54.96 
- **Cases with errors < $20**: 8/30 (26.7%) - well below acceptable threshold
- **Worst error**: $487.36 (Case 26: 5-day trip)

## Critical Issues by Trip Duration

### 1. 5-Day Trips (Highest Priority) 🔴
- **Mean Error**: $305.40 (extremely high)
- **Cases**: 10/30 (33% of test cases)
- **Error Range**: $22.98 - $487.36
- **Status**: Complete failure - model consistently over-predicts by $200-500

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The sweet spot bonus (4-6 day trips get 8% bonus) is inappropriately applied
- Receipt processing logic breaks down with moderate to high receipt amounts
- Base calculation coefficients are wrong for 5-day trips

### 2. 2-Day Trips (Second Priority) 🟡
- **Mean Error**: $82.07 (high)
- **Cases**: 5/30 (17% of test cases)
- **Error Range**: $55.55 - $112.51
- **Status**: Consistent under-prediction

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Two-day coefficients are too conservative
- Base amount (120.0) appears too low
- Miles coefficient (0.55) vs receipts coefficient (0.70) ratio is incorrect

### 3. 3-Day Trips (Third Priority) 🟡
- **Mean Error**: $45.07 (moderate)
- **Cases**: 7/30 (23% of test cases)
- **Error Range**: $23.43 - $79.64
- **Status**: Mixed over/under-prediction

### 4. 1-Day Trips (Good Performance) ✅
- **Mean Error**: $6.52 (acceptable)
- **Cases**: 8/30 (27% of test cases)
- **Error Range**: $1.43 - $12.46
- **Status**: Generally good, minor tuning needed

## Detailed Problem Analysis

### 5-Day Trip Failures
The worst 6 cases are all 5-day trips, with massive over-predictions:

1. **Case 26**: 5-day, 261 miles, $464.94 receipts → Error $487.36
   - Expected: $621.12, Predicted: $1,108.48 (78% over-prediction)
   
2. **Case 23**: 5-day, 592 miles, $433.75 receipts → Error $441.65
   - Expected: $869.00, Predicted: $1,310.65 (51% over-prediction)

**Pattern**: Model severely over-compensates for 5-day trips, especially with moderate-to-high receipts.

### 2-Day Trip Issues
Consistent under-prediction pattern:

- **Case 20**: 2-day, 147 miles, $17.43 receipts → Error $112.51
  - Expected: $325.56, Predicted: $213.05 (35% under-prediction)

## Immediate Tuning Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix 5-Day Trip Logic
```bash
# Current problematic logic:
if [ "$DAYS" -ge 4 ] && [ "$DAYS" -le 6 ]; then
    SWEET_BONUS=$(echo "scale=4; $BASE * 0.08" | bc)  # 8% bonus too high
    BASE=$(echo "scale=4; $BASE + $SWEET_BONUS" | bc)
fi
```

**Suggested Fix**: Remove or significantly reduce the sweet spot bonus for 5-day trips.

### Priority 2: Adjust 2-Day Trip Coefficients
```bash
# Current conservative coefficients:
TWO_DAY_BASE="120.0"    # Increase to ~150-180
TWO_DAY_MILES="0.55"    # Increase to ~0.65-0.70
TWO_DAY_RECEIPTS="0.70" # Increase to ~0.85-1.0
```

### Priority 3: Refine Receipt Processing
The high daily spending penalty is too aggressive:
```bash
# Current penalty logic too harsh for 5-day trips
if (( $(echo "$DAILY_SPENDING > 120" | bc -l) )); then
    PENALTY=$(echo "scale=4; $TOTAL_EXCESS * 0.3" | bc)  # 30% penalty too high
```

## Readiness Assessment

### Current Status: ❌ NOT READY
- Mean error >$125 (target should be <$25)
- Only 26.7% of cases within $20 error (target should be >80%)
- 5-day trips completely broken (30% of test cases)

### Minimum Requirements for Full Evaluation:
1. Mean error < $50
2. >70% of cases with error < $20
3. No trip duration category with mean error > $100

### Estimated Tuning Effort:
- **Time needed**: 2-3 iterations of parameter adjustment
- **Focus areas**: 5-day trip logic overhaul, 2-day coefficient adjustments
- **Risk**: High - fundamental logic flaws in longer trip handling

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix 5-day trip sweet spot bonus (remove or reduce to 2-3%)
2. **Urgent**: Increase 2-day trip base coefficients by 20-30%
3. **Important**: Reduce receipt penalty threshold and penalty rate
4. **Test**: Re-run against first 30 cases after each adjustment
5. **Validate**: Only proceed to full evaluation after mean error <$50

## Conclusion

The model shows promise for 1-day trips but has fundamental flaws in handling multi-day trips, especially 5-day trips. Significant tuning is required before full evaluation. The current error rates would likely result in a very low overall score on the complete test suite.
